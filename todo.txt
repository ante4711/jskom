Single sourcing package version
-------------------------------

We had the version in jskom.version but when including it in setup.py
it depends on third party libs during the setup stagge (since
including jskom.version will include jskom.__init__), so we get a
catch 22 when setuptools should read setup.py to install requirements,
but can't do so because parsing setup.py requires the requirements to
be installed already.

Best alternative idea right now: setuptools_scm
